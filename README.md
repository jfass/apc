# apc

(a) (p)erfect (c)ircle? This is a crude tool to test each DNA sequence in a multi-fasta file for the presence of overlapping ends (i.e. an assembled circular genome or plasmid sequence, which tends to result in some sequence at the 5'- and 3'-ends that overlaps fully on the same strand).

The script requires that the LAST aligner (tested with v548), BWA (tested with v0.7.10), and samtools (tested with v1.2) exist on your PATH.

Bug reports, pull requests welcome. Contact: jnfass@ucdavis.edu
